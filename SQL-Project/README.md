# HOW TO USE SQL-Project's index.php to genere Blog Posts for Bridge Theme
#### Note be sure qode page builder is enabled
1. After you've generated the ScrapedContent
2. Login to cpanel, check the wp_posts table to see what the last index item is.
3. modify index.php with that index
4. php index.php

### Limitations
1. Images being posted as featured images - this will always be done manually, unless all images are the same size, and ext type.  But this has not always been the case for me in my previous projects.
    reason: Photoshop is still required, and the eye of a designer to correctly crop images
