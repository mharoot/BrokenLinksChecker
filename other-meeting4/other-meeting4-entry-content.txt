<p>Lectures, interviews, consultations, and other briefings on the research road to greater discovery&nbsp;can last for hours! Unless you have superhuman memory, chances are that you cannot retain and remember the majority of your research whether it be academic, professional, or personal. Moreover, taking notes doesn’t cut it, and audio recordings aren’t user friendly as&nbsp;skipping through tracks become a mind-numbing endeavor. As we all did in school, the best way to draw conclusions, discover interesting points, and understand your subject is by reading content in text. Unlock&nbsp;that ability through research transcription!</p><h2>Why would it help to have transcribed documentation of&nbsp;your audio and&nbsp;video recordings?</h2><ul><li><strong>Academically:&nbsp;</strong>You may want to write&nbsp;a paper and quote your own professor through your research transcription directly. &nbsp;You possibly desire to have the lecture printed for review so you can study up! However, you’ll need to analyze your subjects spoken word.
